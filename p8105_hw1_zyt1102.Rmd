Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyr)
problem1_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = x>0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "red", "blue", "blue", "yellow", "red", "red", "blue", "blue", "yellow"))
)
problem1_df
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
mean(pull(problem1_df,x))
mean(pull(problem1_df,vec_logical))
mean(pull(problem1_df,vec_char))
mean(pull(problem1_df,vec_factor))
```
The mean of a random sample and a logical vector works, but the mean of a character vector and a factor vector does not work. 

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df,x))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df,vec_factor))
```
```{r}
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df,vec_logical)) * pull(problem1_df,x)
            
as.factor(pull(problem1_df,vec_logical)) * pull(problem1_df,x)
```

Problem 2
```{r}
library("palmerpenguins")
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(as.numeric(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm)), na.rm = TRUE)
summary(penguins)
```
The penguins data set has 8 variables, including species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex and study year. There are 8 colums and 344 rows in the data set. A key variable is the species, which consists of three "levels" including Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. The bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) are all numeric values. The mean flipper length is 200.9152 mm.

```{r}
# Making a scatter plot of flipper length on the y axis and bill length on the x axis.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 6, width = 4)
```
